# SVM
SVM for classification of iris flowers set
A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model set of labelled training data for each category, they are able to categorize new test instances. Support vector based soft computing hybrid technique which can be applied to solve regression problems. The classifier separates data points using a hyperplane with the largest amount of margin. That's why an SVM classifier is also known as a discriminative classifier. SVM finds an optimal hyperplane which helps in classifying new data points. Generally, Support Vector Machines is considered to be a classification approach, it but can be employed in both types of classification and regression problems. It can easily handle multiple continuous and categorical variables. SVM constructs a hyperplane in multidimensional space to separate different classes. We have used Iris Flower dataset for our project on which we have applied SVM algorithm.
The iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species, 
Namely: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.
The four features of the Iris dataset:  sepal length in cm, sepal width in cm,
petal length in cm and petal width in cm. These 4 characteristics are considered to train the model using SVM.
I have used python libraries such as numpy, matplotlib and pandas and Scikit-learn (sklearn), a free machine learning library for implementing SVM algorithm.
I have taken 80% (i.e., 120 out of 150 instances) of the dataset for training and remaining 20% (i.e., 30 out of 150 instances) for testing.
